feat: Implement AI Judging Engine (Chunk 2)

Two-layer AI judging system for deterministic code evaluation:

Layer 1 - AST Structural Analysis:
- Syntax error detection (unmatched brackets, braces, parentheses)
- Security vulnerability scanning (eval, innerHTML, localStorage, document.write)
- Code quality checks (console statements, @ts-ignore, TODO comments)
- File structure analysis and AST hash generation

Layer 2 - EigenAI Semantic Review:
- Mock EigenAI client with deterministic scoring based on seed
- Four-category evaluation: functionality, quality, best practices, innovation
- Weighted score calculation (40/30/20/10 default rubric)
- Automatic feedback and suggestion generation

3-Tier Caching Strategy:
- L1: In-memory cache for immediate responses
- L2: Redis cache for distributed deployment (with fallback)
- L3: Template cache for common code patterns

Rubric System:
- Default rubric (40% functionality, 30% quality, 20% best practices, 10% innovation)
- Custom rubric support with validation
- Adaptive passing thresholds (60-85 range)
- Detailed report generation

Integration:
- /verify-code REST endpoint on TEE server
- ProjectManagerAgent.verifyMilestone() method
- JudgingEngine class with full test coverage

Test Coverage:
- Test A: Syntax error detection (unmatched braces)
- Test B: Security violations (eval, localStorage, document.write)
- Test C: Incomplete implementation (TODO/FIXME comments)
- Test D: Excellent implementation (React hooks, error handling, types)
- Test E: Continuity testing (multi-file project)

All 5 tests passing successfully.
