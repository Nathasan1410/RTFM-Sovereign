feat: Integrate frontend with TEE service for sovereign AI generation

- Update TEE service types to support RoadmapResponse format
- Update EigenAIProvider to generate project-based micro-chunking roadmaps
- Update GroqProvider and BraveProvider to support generateRoadmap
- Update ArchitectAgent to generateRoadmap method
- Update TEE server endpoint to use generateRoadmap
- Update frontend API route to proxy requests to TEE service
- Remove API key configuration from Settings page
- Remove API key warning banner from components

This removes the need for users to configure their own API keys,
leveraging the sovereign TEE service with Eigen AI wallet authentication.
