# RTFM-Sovereign - 5 Minute Demo Script

## 🎤 Complete Pitch Deck & Demo Flow

**Total Time:** 5 minutes  
**Target:** EigenCloud OIC 2026 Hackathon Judges  
**Goal:** Demonstrate verifiable learning with TEE + staking

---

## [SLIDE 1] - Hook (0:00-0:15)

**Visual:** Black screen, white text

```
"RTFM. Read The F*cking Manual."
```

**Speaker:**
> "How many of you have ever tried to learn something new... and just gave up because the docs were too overwhelming?"
> 
> [Pause for show of hands]
> 
> "Yeah. Me too. That's why we built RTFM."

---

## [SLIDE 2] - Problem: The Vibecoder Trap (0:15-0:45)

**Visual:** Meme or screenshot of AI-generated code with 18 hours debugging

```
"Last week I used AI to ship a feature in 1 hour. 
Then spent 18 hours debugging it. 
Because I don't know what my AI writes, 
and I don't know how to read the docs/repo. 
I had no idea what my AI built.

If you're a vibecoder, you know this feeling."
```

**Speaker:**
> "AI made me productive. But it also made me dependent. I was copying code I didn't understand, building features I couldn't explain. And when something broke... I was stuck."
> 
> "The problem isn't laziness. It's that we've lost the ability to learn from documentation."

---

## [SLIDE 3] - Problem: Broken Incentives (0:45-1:15)

**Visual:** Comparison table of current learning platforms

```
"The problem isn't laziness. It's incentives.

Free courses? No commitment. Completion rate is 3%.

Paid courses? $200 to $2000 — still no real incentives. 
The platform doesn't care if you finish or not.

Certificates? There's a lot of fake PDFs nowadays. 
Trust is all-time low. 
And the platform owns them — they can de-platform you anytime."
```

**Speaker:**
> "Think about it. Coursera, Udemy, Pluralsight... they all make money when you buy the course, not when you complete it. Their incentives are misaligned with yours."
> 
> "And certificates? I can make a fake one in Photoshop in 5 minutes. Employers know this. Trust is broken."

---

## [SLIDE 4] - Solution: RTFM (1:15-1:45)

**Visual:** RTFM architecture diagram (User → AI → TEE → Blockchain)

```
"RTFM fixes this by forcing you to read the docs.

AI generates courses from any documentation — repos, API docs, manuals.

You stake to enroll. Complete the work → get refunded plus an on-chain cert. 
If you quit? You lose your stake. Simple."
```

**Speaker:**
> "Here's how we fix it: RTFM uses AI to generate personalized learning paths from ANY documentation. GitHub repos. API docs. User manuals."
> 
> "But here's the key: you stake crypto to enroll. When you finish, you get your stake back PLUS an on-chain certificate that proves your skills. If you quit? You lose your stake. Now the incentives are aligned."

---

## [SLIDE 5] - Acknowledgment (1:45-2:00)

**Visual:** Overwhelming documentation screenshot (e.g., React docs with 100+ pages)

```
"But... Reading Docs can be quite overwhelming..."
```

**Speaker:**
> "Now, I know what you're thinking. 'Just read the docs?' It's not that simple. Documentation is overwhelming. Where do you even start?"
> 
> "That's why we don't just say 'read the docs.' We guide you through them."

---

## [SLIDE 6] - Transition to Demo (2:00-2:15)

**Visual:** Screenshot of RTFM homepage

```
"Let me show you how we simplify the process."
```

**Speaker:**
> "Let me show you the live demo."

---

## 💻 LIVE DEMO (2:15-4:15)

### Demo Flow:

#### Step 1: Homepage (2:15-2:30)

**Action:** Navigate to https://rtfm-sovereign.vercel.app

**Speaker:**
> "This is the homepage. Clean, simple. I'm connected with my wallet — no email, no signup. Here, I enter what I want to learn. Let's say... 'React Cards'."

#### Step 2: Choose Mode (2:30-2:45)

**Action:** Show Learn Mode vs Proof Mode

**Speaker:**
> "Two options:
> - **Learn Mode** — Free, local verification. Good for practice.
> - **Proof Mode** — 0.001 ETH stake. On-chain verification. This is where the magic happens."
> 
> "Let me show you Proof Mode..."

#### Step 3: Stake (2:45-3:00)

**Action:** Click "Stake 0.001 ETH", confirm transaction

**Speaker:**
> "I stake 0.001 ETH — that's about $3-4. This goes into the smart contract."
> 
> "If I quit? I lose 80% — only get 20% back.
> If I finish and pass? I get 80% back and an on-chain certificate."
> 
> "Transaction confirmed. Now it generates my roadmap."

#### Step 4: Roadmap (3:00-3:20)

**Action:** Show generated roadmap with modules

**Speaker:**
> "Done. Here's my learning path. Each module has official React docs links. No tutorials. Just the source material."
> 
> "Notice — the AI didn't just give me a generic course. It read the React documentation and built a custom path for building Cards."

#### Step 5: Challenge (3:20-3:50)

**Action:** Open Module 1, show challenge and code editor

**Speaker:**
> "I'm in Module 1 now. The challenge is clear — build a basic Card component. I can read the docs links if I'm stuck. Then I write my code here in the editor."
> 
> "Notice — I can't skip this. I have to actually build something."

#### Step 6: AI Judge (3:50-4:15)

**Action:** Submit code, show AI verification

**Speaker:**
> "Now the AI judge analyzes my code against the rubric. Does it meet the requirements? Pass or fail. No bluffing."
> 
> [Wait for result]
> 
> "Passed! Now I can move to the next module. This continues until I complete all modules."

## [SLIDE 7] - TEE Verification (4:15-4:30)

**Visual:** TEE attestation diagram or screenshot

```
"Every grade is attested by EigenCloud TEE.
Every credential is on-chain.
Employers can verify without trusting us."
```

**Speaker:**
> "Here's the magic: when I complete the course, the grade isn't just stored in a database. It's signed by a Trusted Execution Environment running on EigenCloud."
> 
> "The TEE verifies my code, signs the attestation, and stores it on-chain. Employers can verify my skills without trusting US. They trust the math."

---

## [SLIDE 8] - Credential Display (4:30-4:45)

**Visual:** On-chain credential explorer or certificate view

```
"You own your credentials.
No one can take them away.
Verify anywhere, anytime."
```

**Speaker:**
> "And now I own this credential. It's on-chain. Even if RTFM shuts down tomorrow, my certificate is verifiable forever."
> 
> "No platform can de-platform me. This is sovereign learning."

---

## [SLIDE 9] - Call to Action (4:45-5:00)

**Visual:** QR code to live demo + GitHub repo

```
"Try it at rtfm-sovereign.vercel.app
Build on EigenCloud.
GitHub: github.com/your-org/rtfm-sovereign"
```

**Speaker:**
> "Try it yourself at rtfm-sovereign.vercel.app. The code is open source. Build on EigenCloud with us."
> 
> "Thank you!"

## 🎬 Backup Plans

### If Demo Fails:

1. **Wallet Connection Issue:**
   - "Let me show you the recorded version..."
   - Switch to backup video

2. **Staking Transaction Fails:**
   - "We're on testnet, let me show you the completed flow..."
   - Show screenshots

3. **AI Takes Too Long:**
   - "The AI is generating... let me show you a completed example..."
   - Open pre-generated roadmap

4. **Network Issues:**
   - Have offline screenshots ready
   - Use local mock mode: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true`

### Pre-Demo Checklist:

- [ ] Wallet connected (MetaMask/WalletConnect)
- [ ] Have 0.01 ETH in wallet (for staking demo)
- [ ] Test staking flow once before recording
- [ ] Clear browser cache
- [ ] Check network status (Sepolia RPC)
- [ ] Have backup screenshots ready
- [ ] Test audio/video recording
