# RTFM-Sovereign - Complete Pitch Deck (Extended Version)

## 🎤 Full Presentation Script with Technical Deep Dive

**Total Time:** 5-7 minutes (adjustable)  
**Target:** EigenCloud OIC 2026 Hackathon Judges  
**Theme:** "Sovereign Learning with Verifiable AI"

---

## [SLIDE 1] - Hook (0:00-0:15)

**Visual:** Black screen, white text

```
"RTFM. Read The F*cking Manual."
```

**Speaker:**
> "How many of you have ever tried to learn something new... and just gave up because the docs were too overwhelming?"
> 
> [Pause]
> 
> "Yeah. Me too."

---

## [SLIDE 2] - Problem: The Vibecoder Trap (0:15-0:45)

**Visual:** Screenshot of AI code + 18 hours debugging meme

```
"Last week I used AI to ship a feature in 1 hour. 
Then spent 18 hours debugging it. 
Because I don't know what my AI writes.
I had no idea what my AI built.

If you're a vibecoder, you know this feeling."
```

**Speaker:**
> "AI made me productive. But it also made me dependent. I was copying code I didn't understand. And when something broke... I was stuck."

---

## [SLIDE 3] - Problem: Broken Incentives (0:45-1:15)

**Visual:** Comparison table

```
"The problem isn't laziness. It's incentives.

Free courses? No commitment. Completion rate: 3%

Paid courses? $200-$2000 — still no real incentives.
The platform doesn't care if you finish.

Certificates? Fake PDFs everywhere. Trust is all-time low.
And platforms can de-platform you anytime."
```

**Speaker:**
> "Coursera, Udemy... they make money when you buy, not when you complete. Their incentives are misaligned with yours."

---

## [SLIDE 4] - Solution: RTFM (1:15-1:45)

**Visual:** RTFM architecture diagram

```
"RTFM fixes this by forcing you to read the docs.

AI generates courses from any documentation — repos, API docs, manuals.

You stake to enroll. Complete → get refunded + on-chain cert.
Quit? Lose your stake. Simple."
```

**Speaker:**
> "AI generates personalized learning paths from ANY documentation. You stake crypto. Finish = stake back + certificate. Quit = lose stake. Now incentives are aligned."

---

## [SLIDE 5] - Acknowledgment (1:45-2:00)

**Visual:** Overwhelming React docs screenshot

```
"But... Reading Docs can be quite overwhelming..."
```

**Speaker:**
> "I know. 'Just read the docs' isn't helpful. That's why we guide you through them."

---

## [SLIDE 6] - Transition to Demo (2:00-2:15)

**Visual:** RTFM homepage screenshot

```
"Let me show you how we simplify the process."
```

---

## 💻 LIVE DEMO (2:15-4:15)

*[Follow the demo flow from previous script]*

## [SLIDE 7] - Technical Deep Dive: EigenLayer Integration (4:15-4:45)

**Visual:** EigenLayer + EigenCloud architecture diagram

```
"Deployment on EigenLayer
Using EigenAI (GPT-OSS-120B)
Future Compatibility with Opik AI:
  • AI Safeguard
  • Traceability
  • Optimization & Evaluation

People can see what's going on behind.
No one can freeze/seize/de-platform you."
```

**Speaker:**
> "Here's what makes this different:
> 
> **First**, we're deployed on EigenLayer. This means our TEE attestations are backed by Ethereum's economic security.
> 
> **Second**, we use EigenAI with GPT-OSS-120B for code verification. This is open-source, auditable, and runs in TEEs.
> 
> **Third**, we're building integration with Opik AI for:
> - **AI Safeguard**: Prevent biased or malicious grading
> - **Traceability**: Track every AI decision
> - **Optimization**: Continuous improvement of AI judges
> - **Evaluation**: Transparent scoring metrics
> 
> **Most importantly**: Everything is transparent. You can see exactly how the AI grades your code. And because it's on EigenLayer, no one can freeze, seize, or de-platform your credentials. They're yours forever."

---

## [SLIDE 8] - Transparency & Trust (4:45-5:15)

**Visual:** Code verification flow with visibility

```
"Transparency by Design:
✓ AI grading rubric visible before submission
✓ Code verification process auditable
✓ TEE attestation publicly verifiable
✓ On-chain credential history
✓ Open-source AI models (GPT-OSS-120B)

Future: A/B Testing for Trust
- Multiple AI judges per submission
- Community-voted grading rubrics
- Transparent accuracy metrics"
```

**Speaker:**
> "Trust isn't optional. It's built in:
> 
> Before you submit, you see the exact rubric. After submission, you can audit how the AI graded you. The TEE attestation is publicly verifiable on-chain.
> 
> **For the future**: We're planning A/B testing where multiple AI judges grade the same submission. The community can vote on which rubrics are fairest. We'll publish accuracy metrics openly.
> 
> This isn't just 'trust us.' It's 'verify us.'"

## [SLIDE 9] - Roadmap (5:15-5:45)

**Visual:** Roadmap timeline (honest about what's done vs. coming)

```
"Roadmap

✅ DONE:
- Smart contract staking system
- TEE-powered attestation
- AI challenge generation
- Frontend application
- EigenLayer deployment

🚧 COMING SOON:
- Visible code generation process
- Agentic AI maintenance (self-improving)
- A/B testing for AI judges
- Stablecoin support (USDC, DAI, USDT)
- Multi-chain deployment (Polygon, Arbitrum)
- Mobile app (React Native)

🔮 FUTURE:
- Opik AI integration (safeguards + traceability)
- Enterprise features (team challenges)
- DAO governance (community-owned)
- Cross-platform credential portability"
```

**Speaker:**
> "Here's where we are:
> 
> **Done**: Smart contracts, TEE service, AI generation, frontend, EigenLayer deployment.
> 
> **Coming Soon**: We're making the code generation process visible step-by-step. The system will be maintained by Agentic AI — self-improving. A/B testing for trust. And stablecoin support so you can stake with USDC instead of ETH.
> 
> **Future**: Opik AI integration, enterprise features, and eventually DAO governance. This won't be my project. It'll be yours."

---

## [SLIDE 10] - Stablecoin Support (5:45-6:00)

**Visual:** Stablecoin logos (USDC, DAI, USDT)

```
"Stablecoin Support (Coming Q2 2026)

Stake with:
- USDC
- DAI
- USDT
- Any ERC-20 token

Why?
- No ETH volatility risk
- Predictable learning costs
- Easier for enterprises
- Global accessibility"
```

**Speaker:**
> "One more thing: We're adding stablecoin support. Stake with USDC, DAI, or USDT instead of ETH. No volatility risk. Predictable costs. Better for enterprises and global users."

---

## 🔧 Technical Details for Q&A

### EigenLayer Integration
```solidity
// Using EigenLayer's TEE attestation verification
contract RTFMVerifiableRegistry {
    function verifyAttestation(
        bytes calldata attestation,
        bytes32 eigenLayerProof
    ) external returns (bool) {
        // Verify TEE attestation via EigenLayer
        return IEigenLayer(attestationVerifier).verify(
            attestation,
            eigenLayerProof
        );
    }
}
```

### Opik AI Integration (Planned)
```python
# Future Opik AI integration for traceability
from opik import track, Opik

client = Opik()

@track(type="llm_judge")
def grade_code(user_code: str, rubric: dict) -> dict:
    # Track every grading decision
    evaluation = client.evaluate(
        input=user_code,
        output=grade,
        rubric=rubric,
        metadata={"model": "GPT-OSS-120B"}
    )
    
    # Log for transparency
    client.log_trace(evaluation)
    
    return evaluation
```

### Stablecoin Support (Planned)
```solidity
// Support multiple tokens for staking
contract RTFMStaking {
    mapping(address => uint256) public supportedTokens; // token => stakeAmount
    
    function stakeWithToken(
        address token,
        string calldata topic
    ) external {
        require(supportedTokens[token] > 0, "Token not supported");
        
        // Transfer tokens from user
        IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), stakeAmount);
        
        // Record stake
        stakes[msg.sender][topic] = Stake({
            token: token,
            amount: stakeAmount,
            deadline: block.timestamp + TIMEOUT
        });
    }
}
```

## 🎬 Backup Plans

### If Demo Fails:
1. **Wallet Issue**: "Let me show you the recorded version..." → Switch to video
2. **Transaction Fails**: "We're on testnet..." → Show screenshots
3. **AI Slow**: "Let me show you a completed example..." → Pre-generated roadmap
4. **Network Down**: Use offline screenshots + mock mode

### Pre-Demo Checklist:
- [ ] Wallet connected (MetaMask/WalletConnect)
- [ ] 0.01 ETH in wallet (for staking)
- [ ] Test staking flow once before
- [ ] Clear browser cache
- [ ] Check Sepolia RPC status
- [ ] Backup screenshots ready
- [ ] Test audio/video
- [ ] Have QR codes printed (if presenting live)
