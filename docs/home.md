# RTFM-GPT Documentation

**Read The F*cking Manual**

Welcome to the official documentation for RTFM-GPT. This project is built on the philosophy of **"Curating Ignorance"** - telling you *what* to learn, but forcing you to read the official documentation for the *how*.

## Philosophy

Most developers rely too heavily on tutorials and StackOverflow copy-pasting. This hinders deep understanding. RTFM-GPT solves this by:
1.  **Curating Ignorance**: Telling you *what* to learn, not *how*.
2.  **Forcing References**: Linking directly to official docs (React docs, MDN, Rust book, etc.).
3.  **Active Recall**: Challenging you to implement concepts based on what you read.
