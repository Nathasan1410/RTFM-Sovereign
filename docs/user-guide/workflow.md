# The RTFM Workflow

RTFM-GPT is designed to force you to learn by reading.

## Step 1: Generate Roadmap

Enter a topic (e.g., "React Server Components") in the landing page input. The AI will generate a structured roadmap with 5-7 modules.

## Step 2: Read The Manual

Click on a module. In the split view:
1.  Read the **Reference** context on the left.
2.  Click the **"READ THE MANUAL"** button. This opens the official documentation in a new tab.
3.  **READ IT.** Do not skim. Do not watch a YouTube video. Read the text.

> **Warning**: Skipping this step defeats the purpose of the tool.

## Step 3: The Challenge

Once you've read the documentation, look at the **Challenge** on the right.
It will ask you to implement something or explain a concept based *strictly* on what you just read.

## Step 4: Complete

Toggle the **"Mark as Complete"** button. Your progress is saved locally.
Repeat for the next module.
